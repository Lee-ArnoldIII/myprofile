As my skills increase, I will update the layout and features of this site. It is meant to serve as a learnig experience for me and a chance for others to see how far my abilities have come.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>I started my dev journey in 2018 after a friend suggested that I get my scrum master certification. I took the course and got certified, but there was a nagging issue that I kept running into: non-technical scrum masters have a harder time getting a job.</p>
  <p> I decided that I was going to start learning coding to gain some advantages in the field and to have a better understanding of the roles that would be important in a dev team. I started with FreeCodeCamp and haven't looked back since.</p>

    <h2>Current and Future projects</h2>
    <p>I have been working through the projects for FreeCodeCamp with some success. Below are a few of the completed projects. I will add more as they come, and eventually I will have links to my work for DigitalCrafts.</p>
